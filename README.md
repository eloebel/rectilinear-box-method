# Rectilinear box method: tracking glacier terminus change
The rectilinear box method is a well-established tool for tracking glacier terminus change. Rather than using a single profile to measure advance or retreat, this method uses a rectilinear box that accounts for uneven changes along the calving front. This technique was first described by [Moon and Joughin, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JF000927). Here we provide a complete and easy to use implementation of the method.

## Usage
All processing is done via the script `box_method.py`. Necessary requirements can be installed using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This repository already includes a working example for the Glacier Harald Moltke Br√¶.
